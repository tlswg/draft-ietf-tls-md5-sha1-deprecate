     <t>The MD5 and SHA-1 hashing algorithms are steadily weakening in strength and
             their deprecation process should begin for their use in TLS 1.2 digital signatures.
             However, this document does not deprecate SHA-1 in HMAC for record protection.

   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>The usage of MD5 and SHA-1 for signature hashing in TLS 1.2 is specified in <xref
     target="RFC5246">RFC&nbsp;5246</xref>. MD5 and SHA-1 have been proven to be insecure, 
     subject to collision attacks. <xref target="RFC6151">RFC&nbsp;6151</xref> details the security considerations, including collision attacks 
     for MD5, published in 2011.  NIST formally deprecated use of SHA-1 in 2011 
   <xref target="NISTSP800-131A-R2"></xref> and 
    disallowed its use for digital signatures at the end of 2013, based on both the Wang, et. al, attack and the 
    potential for brute-force attack.  Further, in 2017, researchers from Google and CWI Amsterdam 
    <xref target="SHA-1-Collision"></xref> 
    proved SHA-1 collision attacks were practical.
     This document updates <xref
     target="RFC5246">RFC&nbsp;5246</xref> and <xref target="RFC7525">RFC7525 </xref> 
     in such as way that MD5 and SHA1 MUST NOT
     be used for digital signatures.  However, this document does not deprecate SHA-1 in HMAC for record protection.

   <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
    1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
    2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here

    Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
    If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
    directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
    with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
    filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
