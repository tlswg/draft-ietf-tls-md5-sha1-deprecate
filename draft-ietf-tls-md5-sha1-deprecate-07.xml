       <t>
           The MD5 and SHA-1 hashing algorithms are increasingly vulnerable to attack and this document deprecates their use in TLS 1.2 digital signatures.
        However, this document does not deprecate SHA-1 in HMAC for record protection. This document updates RFC 5246 and RFC 7525.
    </t>

   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>The usage of MD5 and SHA-1 for signature hashing in TLS 1.2 is specified in <xref
     target="RFC5246"/>. MD5 and SHA-1 have been proven to be insecure, 
     subject to collision attacks <xref target="Wang" />. In 2011, <xref target="RFC6151" /> detailed the security considerations, including collision attacks 
     for MD5.  NIST formally deprecated use of SHA-1 in 2011 
   <xref target="NISTSP800-131A-R2" /> and 
    disallowed its use for digital signatures at the end of 2013, based on both the Wang, et. al, attack and the 
    potential for brute-force attack.  In 2016, researchers from INRIA identified
    a new class of transcript collision attacks on TLS (and other protocols)
    that rely on efficient collision-finding algorithms on the underlying hash
    constructions <xref target="Transcript-Collision" />.  Further, in 2017,
    researchers from Google and CWI Amsterdam 
    <xref target="SHA-1-Collision" /> 
    proved SHA-1 collision attacks were practical.
     This document updates <xref
     target="RFC5246" /> and <xref target="RFC7525" />
     in such a way that MD5 and SHA-1 MUST NOT
     be used for digital signatures.  However, this document does not deprecate SHA-1 in HMAC for record protection.
     Note that the CABF has also deprecated use of SHA-1 <xref target="CABF"/>.

   <t>
   Clients MUST NOT include MD5 and SHA-1 in the signature_algorithms extension. If
   a client does not send a signature_algorithms extension, then the server
   MUST abort the handshake and send a handshake_failure alert, except when
   digital signatures are not used (for example, when using PSK ciphers).

<section anchor="updates_to_rfc5246" title="Updates to RFC5246">
<t>
<xref target="RFC5246" />, The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol
Version 1.2, suggests that implementations can assume support for MD5 and SHA-1
by their peer. This update changes the suggestion to assume support for SHA-256
instead, due to MD5 and SHA-1 being deprecated.
</t>
<t>In Section 7.4.1.4.1: the text should be revised from:
</t>
<t> OLD: </t>
<t>
   "Note: this is
   a change from TLS 1.1 where there are no explicit rules, but as a
   practical matter one can assume that the peer supports MD5 and SHA-

<t>
<xref target="RFC7525" />, Recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer Security (TLS) and 
Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS), recommends use of SHA-256 as a minimum requirement.  
This update moves the minimum recommendation to use stronger language deprecating use of 
both SHA-1 and MD5.  The prior text did not explicitly include MD5 or SHA-1; and this text
adds guidance to ensure that these algorithms have been deprecated.
</t>
<t>Section 4.3:</t>
<t>OLD:</t>
<t>   When using RSA, servers SHOULD authenticate using certificates with
   at least a 2048-bit modulus for the public key.  In addition, the use of the
   SHA-256 hash algorithm is RECOMMENDED (see <xref target="CAB-Baseline"></xref> for
   more details).  Clients SHOULD indicate to servers that they request
   SHA-256, by using the "Signature Algorithms" extension defined in
   TLS 1.2.</t>
