        Deprecating MD5 and SHA-1 signature hashes in (D)TLS 1.2
                  draft-ietf-tls-md5-sha1-deprecate-08

Abstract

   The MD5 and SHA-1 hashing algorithms are increasingly vulnerable to
   attack and this document deprecates their use in TLS 1.2 digital
   signatures.  However, this document does not deprecate SHA-1 in HMAC
   for record protection.  This document updates RFC 5246.

1.  Introduction

   The usage of MD5 and SHA-1 for signature hashing in TLS 1.2 is
   specified in [RFC5246].  MD5 and SHA-1 have been proven to be
   insecure, subject to collision attacks [Wang].  In 2011, [RFC6151]
   detailed the security considerations, including collision attacks for
   MD5.  NIST formally deprecated use of SHA-1 in 2011
   [NISTSP800-131A-R2] and disallowed its use for digital signatures at
   the end of 2013, based on both the Wang, et. al, attack and the
   potential for brute-force attack.  In 2016, researchers from INRIA
   identified a new class of transcript collision attacks on TLS (and
   other protocols) that rely on efficient collision-finding algorithms
   on the underlying hash constructions [Transcript-Collision].
   Further, in 2017, researchers from Google and CWI Amsterdam
   [SHA-1-Collision] proved SHA-1 collision attacks were practical.
   This document updates [RFC5246] in such a way that MD5 and SHA-1 MUST
   NOT be used for digital signatures.  However, this document does not
   deprecate SHA-1 in HMAC for record protection.  Note that the CABF
   has also deprecated use of SHA-1 [CABF].

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Signature Algorithms

   Clients MUST include the signature_algorithms extension.  Clients
   MUST NOT include MD5 and SHA-1 in this extension.

3.  Certificate Request

   Servers SHOULD NOT include MD5 and SHA-1 in CertificateRequest
   messages.

4.  Server Key Exchange

   Servers MUST NOT include MD5 and SHA-1 in ServerKeyExchange messages.
   If no other signature algorithms are available (for example, if the
   client does not send a signature_algorithms extension), the server
   MUST abort the handshake with a handshake_failure alert or select a
   different cipher suite.

5.  Certificate Verify

   Clients MUST NOT include MD5 and SHA-1 in CertificateVerify messages.
   If a server receives a CertificateVerify message with MD5 or SHA-1 it
   MUST abort the connection with handshake_failure or
   insufficient_security alert.

6.  IANA Considerations

   The document updates the "TLS SignatureScheme" registry to change the
   recommended status of SHA-1 based signature schemes to N (not
   recommended) as defined by [RFC8447].  The following entries are to
   be updated:

      +--------+----------------+-------------+--------------------+
      | Value  |  Description   | Recommended |     Reference      |
      +--------+----------------+-------------+--------------------+
      | 0x0201 | rsa_pkcs1_sha1 |      N      | [RFC8446] [RFCTBD] |
      | 0x0203 |   ecdsa_sha1   |      N      | [RFC8446] [RFCTBD] |
      +--------+----------------+-------------+--------------------+

   Other entries of the registry remain the same.

   IANA is also requested to update the Reference for the TLS
   SignatureAlgorithm and TLS HashAlgorithm registries to refer to this
   RFC:

7.  Security Considerations

   Concerns with TLS 1.2 implementations falling back to SHA-1 is an
   issue.  This document updates the TLS 1.2 specification to deprecate
   support for MD5 and SHA-1 for digital signatures.  However, this
   document does not deprecate SHA-1 in HMAC for record protection.

   the initial draft.  We are also grateful to Daniel Migault, Martin
   Thomson, Sean Turner, Christopher Wood and David Cooper for their
