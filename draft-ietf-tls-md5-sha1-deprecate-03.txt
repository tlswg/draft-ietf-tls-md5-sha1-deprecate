         Deprecating MD5 and SHA-1 signature hashes in TLS 1.2
                  draft-ietf-tls-md5-sha1-deprecate-05

Abstract

   The MD5 and SHA-1 hashing algorithms are increasingly vulnerable to
   attack and this document deprecates their use in TLS 1.2 digital
   signatures.  However, this document does not deprecate SHA-1 in HMAC
   for record protection.  This document updates RFC 5246 and RFC 7525.

1.  Introduction

   The usage of MD5 and SHA-1 for signature hashing in TLS 1.2 is
   specified in [RFC5246].  MD5 and SHA-1 have been proven to be
   insecure, subject to collision attacks [Wang].  In 2011, [RFC6151]
   detailed the security considerations, including collision attacks for
   MD5.  NIST formally deprecated use of SHA-1 in 2011
   [NISTSP800-131A-R2] and disallowed its use for digital signatures at
   the end of 2013, based on both the Wang, et. al, attack and the
   potential for brute-force attack.  In 2016, researchers from INRIA
   identified a new class of transcript collision attacks on TLS (and
   other protocols) that rely on efficient collision-finding algorithms
   on the underlying hash constructions [Transcript-Collision].
   Further, in 2017, researchers from Google and CWI Amsterdam
   [SHA-1-Collision] proved SHA-1 collision attacks were practical.
   This document updates [RFC5246] and [RFC7525] in such a way that MD5
   and SHA-1 MUST NOT be used for digital signatures.  However, this
   document does not deprecate SHA-1 in HMAC for record protection.

1.1.  Requirements Language

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

2.  Signature Algorithms

   Clients MUST NOT include MD5 and SHA-1 in the signature_algorithms
   extension.  If a client does not send a signature_algorithms
   extension, then the server MUST abort the handshake and send a
   handshake_failure alert, except when digital signatures are not used
   (for example, when using PSK ciphers).

3.  Certificate Request

   Servers SHOULD NOT include MD5 and SHA-1 in CertificateRequest
   messages.

4.  Server Key Exchange

   Servers MUST NOT include MD5 and SHA-1 in ServerKeyExchange messages.
   If a client receives a MD5 or SHA-1 signature in a ServerKeyExchange
   message it MUST abort the connection with the illegal_parameter
   alert.

5.  Certificate Verify

   Clients MUST NOT include MD5 and SHA-1 in CertificateVerify messages.
   If a server receives a CertificateVerify message with MD5 or SHA-1 it
   MUST abort the connection with handshake_failure or
   insufficient_security alert.

6.  Updates to RFC5246

   [RFC5246], The Transport Layer Security (TLS) Protocol Version 1.2,
   suggests that implementations can assume support for MD5 and SHA-1 by
   their peer.  This update changes the suggestion to assume support for
   SHA-256 instead, due to MD5 and SHA-1 being deprecated.

   In Section 7.4.1.4.1: the text should be revised from:

   OLD:

   "Note: this is a change from TLS 1.1 where there are no explicit
   rules, but as a practical matter one can assume that the peer
   supports MD5 and SHA- 1."

   NEW:

   "Note: This is a change from TLS 1.1 where there are no explicit
   rules, but as a practical matter one can assume that the peer
   supports SHA-256."

7.  Updates to RFC7525

   [RFC7525], Recommendations for Secure Use of Transport Layer Security
   (TLS) and Datagram Transport Layer Security (DTLS) recommends use of
   SHA-256 as a minimum requirement.  This update moves the minimum
   recommendation to use stronger language deprecating use of both SHA-1
   and MD5.  The prior text did not explicitly include MD5 or SHA-1; and
   this text adds guidance to ensure that these algorithms have been
   deprecated.

   Section 4.3:

   OLD:

   When using RSA, servers SHOULD authenticate using certificates with
   at least a 2048-bit modulus for the public key.  In addition, the use
   of the SHA-256 hash algorithm is RECOMMENDED (see [CAB-Baseline] for
   more details).  Clients SHOULD indicate to servers that they request
   SHA-256, by using the "Signature Algorithms" extension defined in TLS
   1.2.

   NEW:

   Servers SHOULD authenticate using certificates with at least a
   2048-bit modulus for the public key.

   In addition, the use of the SHA-256 hash algorithm is RECOMMENDED;
   and SHA-1 or MD5 MUST NOT be used (see [CAB-Baseline] for more
   details).  Clients MUST indicate to servers that they request SHA-
   256, by using the "Signature Algorithms" extension defined in TLS
   1.2.

8.  IANA Considerations

   The document updates the "TLS SignatureScheme" registry to change the
   recommended status of SHA-1 based signature schemes to N (not
   recommended) as defined by [RFC8447].  The following entries are to
   be updated:

      +--------+----------------+-------------+--------------------+
      | Value  |  Description   | Recommended |     Reference      |
      +--------+----------------+-------------+--------------------+
      | 0x0201 | rsa_pkcs1_sha1 |      N      | [RFC8446] [RFCTBD] |
      | 0x0203 |   ecdsa_sha1   |      N      | [RFC8446] [RFCTBD] |
      +--------+----------------+-------------+--------------------+

   Other entries of the registry remain the same.

9.  Security Considerations

   Concerns with TLS 1.2 implementations falling back to SHA-1 is an
   issue.  This document updates the TLS 1.2 specification to deprecate
   support for MD5 and SHA-1 for digital signatures.  However, this
   document does not deprecate SHA-1 in HMAC for record protection.
